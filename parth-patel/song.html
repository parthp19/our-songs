  <h1>Feel It Still</h1>
  <h2>Portugal. The Man</h2> Can't keep my hands to myself<br>
  <p>
    Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf<br> In case my little baby girl is in need<br> Am I coming out of left field?<br>
    <br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br> I been feeling it since 1966, now<br> Might be over now, but I feel it still<br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br> Let me kick it like it's 1986, now<br> Might be over now, but I feel it
    still<br>
    <br> Got another mouth to feed<br> Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger<br> Gone with the fallen leaves<br> Am I coming out of left field?<br>
    <br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br> I been feeling it since 1966, now<br> Might've had your fill, but you feel it still<br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br> Let me kick it like it's 1986, now<br> Might be over now, but I
    feel it still<br>
    <br> We could fight a war for peace<br> (Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)<br> Give in to that easy living<br> Goodbye to my hopes and dreams<br> Start flipping for my enemies<br> We could wait until the walls come down<br> (Ooh woo, I'm a
    rebel just for kicks, now)<br> It's time to give a little to the<br> Kids in the middle, but, oh until it falls<br> Won't bother me<br>
    <br> Is it coming?<br> Is it coming?<br> Is it coming?<br> Is it coming?<br> Is it coming?<br> Is it coming back?<br>
    <br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah<br> Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now<br> Might be over now, but I feel it still<br>
    <br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br> I've been feeling it since 1966, now<br> Might be over now, but I feel it still<br> Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br> Let me kick it like it's 1986, now<br> Might be over now, but I feel
    it still<br> Might've had your fill, but I feel it still<br></p>
